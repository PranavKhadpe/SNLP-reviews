read_file.py is a script to separate real and fake reviews in a simple, naive way.
	Use it as 'python read_file.py folder_name file_name'
	where file_name is the name of the text file that contains the real and fake reviews
	and folder_name is the name of the containing folder

	The script will write two files, one containg real reviews, and another containing fake reviews in the folder specified.
